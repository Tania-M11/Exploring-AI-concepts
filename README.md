# Talento-Tech_IA
Artificial intelligence bootcamp activities🤖
🌸In this repository we find:

    
   🟤**TensorFlow Playground**
   We explore how tuning different hyperparameters affects the performance of a neural network. 
   Specifically, we focus on the impact of increasing training layers and epochs, along with the 
   application of L1 and L2 regularization techniques.🌀
   
   🟢**Neural Network Programming**
   In this project we will see three forms of neural network programming,using: 
   tensorflow, keras, Sklearn.🧠

   🔵**Cats and dogs classifier**
   This model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to 
   classify dog ​​and cat images.🐱🐶
